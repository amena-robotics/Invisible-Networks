# Invisible Networks 🐟
Swarm robotics project showcasing emergent collective behaviour in biomimetic fish. 

## OVERVIEW
In a world of invisible forces, power no longer sits at the centre: it moves like a school of fish, fluid, responsive, uncatchable.

'Invisible Networks' uses biomimetic robotic fish to showcase the power of decentralised systems. Inspired by natural fish schools, each agent operates independently without central control yet responds in beautiful synchrony with its neighbours through local interactions. 

This project was accepted as an academic poster at the **2025 Ada Lovelace Colloquium**.
